# Summary Notes: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Terraform

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

-   **Definition:** IaC allows managing infrastructure using
    configuration files instead of GUIs.
-   **Purpose:** Ensures safe, consistent, and repeatable infrastructure
    management.
-   **Key Benefits:**
    -   Infrastructure configurations are **versioned, reusable, and
        shareable**.
    -   Enables **automation** and reduces manual errors.

## Terraform Overview

-   **Tool:** Terraform by HashiCorp is an **Infrastructure as Code**
    tool.
-   **Functionality:** Defines infrastructure resources using
    **human-readable, declarative configuration files**.
-   **Lifecycle Management:** Handles the creation, modification, and
    destruction of infrastructure resources.

### Advantages of Terraform

-   Works across **multiple cloud platforms** (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.).
-   Uses **declarative language** that simplifies configuration writing.
-   Maintains a **state file** to track changes and current
    infrastructure status.
-   Supports **version control integration** for collaboration and
    rollback safety.

## Managing Infrastructure

-   **Providers:** Plugins that connect Terraform with external
    platforms via APIs.
    -   Over **1,000+ providers** available (e.g., AWS, GCP, Kubernetes,
        GitHub).
    -   Custom providers can be created if none exist.
-   **Modules:** Collections of reusable Terraform configurations.
-   **Declarative Syntax:** Focuses on *desired end state*, not the
    procedural steps.

## Terraform Deployment Workflow

1.  **Scope:** Identify required infrastructure.
2.  **Author:** Write configuration files.
3.  **Initialize:** Install required providers/plugins.
4.  **Plan:** Preview infrastructure changes.
5.  **Apply:** Execute changes to match configuration.

## State Management

-   Terraform uses a **state file** as the *source of truth*.
-   Tracks resource mappings and determines required updates
    automatically.

## Collaboration Features

-   **Remote State Backends:** Allow multiple users to share and manage
    state files safely.
-   **HCP Terraform:**
    -   Free for up to 5 users.
    -   Prevents race conditions during concurrent edits.
-   **VCS Integration:** Works with GitHub, GitLab, etc.
    -   Automatically proposes infrastructure changes upon commits.

## Quick Start

-   Learn Terraform by deploying and destroying Docker containers using
    an **interactive terminal lab**.

## Next Steps

-   Install Terraform locally.
-   Deploy your first infrastructure resource (e.g., Docker container).
