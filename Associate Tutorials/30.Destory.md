# Destroy Resources and Workspaces — Summary Notes

## Overview
In this tutorial, you learn how to **safely destroy your infrastructure** and **clean up your HCP Terraform workspace and project**.  
Destroying resources ensures that you don’t leave running infrastructure (and incur costs), while deleting workspaces/projects cleans up your Terraform Cloud environment.

---

## 1️⃣ Destroy Infrastructure

### Two destruction methods
| Method | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Remove resources from config + apply** | Deletes specific resources selectively |
| **Run destroy operation** | Deletes **all** resources managed by the workspace |

---

### Using the HCP Terraform UI
1. Go to your workspace (e.g., **learn-hcp-terraform-run-triggers**).  
2. Click **Settings → Destruction and Deletion**.

This page gives two options:
- **Queue destroy plan** → Destroys all infrastructure managed by this workspace.  
- **Delete from HCP Terraform** → Deletes the workspace without touching infrastructure.

⚠️ **Warning:** Deleting a workspace **does not destroy** its infrastructure — resources (e.g., EC2 instances) remain active in the provider.

3. Click **Queue destroy plan**.  
4. Type your workspace name to confirm.  
5. Click **Confirm & apply**, then **Confirm plan**.

Repeat these steps for each workspace (e.g., `learn-hcp-terraform`).

---

## 2️⃣ Delete Workspace
Destroying infrastructure removes resources but keeps the workspace.  
To delete the workspace entirely (including variables and configuration):

1. Go to **Settings → Destruction and Deletion**.  
2. Under **Delete Workspace**, click **Delete from HCP Terraform**.  
3. Confirm the workspace name when prompted.  

💡 **Tip:** Keep the workspace if you plan to redeploy resources later — variables and configuration will remain intact.

---

## 3️⃣ Delete Project and Variable Set
If you want to completely remove your HCP Terraform project:

1. From your **organization overview**, click **Projects**.  
2. Choose your **Learn Terraform** project.  
3. Click **Settings → Delete project**.  
4. Enter the project name and confirm deletion.

Deleting the project also deletes any **scoped variable sets** (e.g., AWS credentials).

⚠️ **Tip:** Keep the project if you plan to use it for future tutorials or additional workspaces.

## ✅ Summary
- Destroyed all infrastructure safely using **HCP Terraform destroy**.  
- Deleted unused **workspaces**, **projects**, and **variable sets**.  
- Cleaned up your environment to avoid charges and clutter.  
- Prepared your HCP Terraform org for future tutorials or automation workflows.
